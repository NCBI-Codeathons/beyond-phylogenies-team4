## Needs for the project

1. If sequence not part of original cluster X, label as CX.1 (BRM)
2. Remove discard tree analysis (until later date) (BRM)
3. Modify mut_analysis.R to use vcf instead of msa
4. Modify variant_plotting.R to utilize a VOC file
5. Modify visualization to include tree (already annotated)
6. Remove any specific references to FL for any regional analysis
7. Replace FastTreeMP with matUtils matOptimize?
8. May need to modify output metadata file from metadata.R so that column names are ID and DATE and first two columns
